/*
 * Q: What are the differences between rest and spread? When would each be
 * appropriate too use? In your own words, write 1 - 2 paragraphs explaining
 * the different use-cases for each.
 * 
 * A: The rest operator is used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function,
 * and it has to be the last one in the arguments list. If the name of the function
 * argument starts with the three dots (...), the function will get the rest of the
 * arguments in an array.
 * 
 * The spread operator is also represented by three dots (...) like the
 * rest operator, but the spread operator do the opposite: turns an array into
 * a list of values or function parameters.

// Rest operator example
function student(name, age, ...moreArguments) {
  console.log(name);
  console.log(age);
  console.log(moreArguments);
}

student("Alejandro", "35", "JavaScript", "ES6", "Homework", "Developer");


// Spread operator example
var array1 = [0, 1, 2];
var array2 = [3, 4, 5];

arraySpread = [...array1, ...array2];
console.log(arraySpread);


function sum(x, y, z) {
  return x + y + z;
}
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(sum(...numbers));
